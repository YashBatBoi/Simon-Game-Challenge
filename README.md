# Simon-Game-Challenge-Starting-Files

This is just a summarizing game that we had play when all of us are once kid.

There are four colour buttons and as the game start the computer will automatically clicks button, 
and we had to follow that pattern that the computer is making by pressing the random buttons and if we 
push or click a wrong pattern then game will over, and you had to restart it again by just pressing any 
key.
